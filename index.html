  <h3>Zero G Arena</h3>
  <p>Zero G Arena is a fully released PC game that I developed over the course of about three and a half years. It's an online multiplayer competetive shooter game with unique zero gravity mechanics.</p>

  <h4>Technology:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Unreal Engine 4</li>
    <li>C++</li>
    <li>Blueprint Visual Scripting</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Achievements:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Making an entirely custom built AI to accomodate ZGA's unique game mechanics. This involved creating custom navigation systems.</li>
    <li>Succesfully implementing networked gameplay.</li>
    <li>Finishing a fully-featured comercial game project. The game was also well received by players, sitting at 92% positive reviews on Steam at the time of writing (This will probably deteriorate further in the game's lifecycle, due to complaints of not enough players but the core gameplay has always been liked).
    <li>Acting on player feedback to improve the game over the course of 2 years in Early Access.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Space Game</h3>
  <p>My first non-trivial programming project. It's a (pretty generic) 2d top down space shooter, not unlike the classic arcade game "Asteroids". This was only ever supposed to be a learning project, but it was extremely effective for learning C++ and game programming in general.</p>
  <p>The comparitively low-level nature of SFML (as compared to game engines like UE4) provided a great introduction to a lot of the more low-level problems in game development.</p>

  <h3>Simple Evolution Simulator</h3>
  <p>A fun little side project that I embarked upon for a brief break from Zero G Arena. I wanted to make a simulated environment with (imperfectly) self-replicating organisms. I did actually achieve this, although the result wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped. I would have liked to develop the project further (and I'm sure I'll do something like this again), but felt I needed to get back to Zero G Arena. </p>

  <h3>Zero G Arena Soundtrack</h3>
  <p>
  In the last few months before the final launch I took a little time here and there (generally when I was too tired to program) working on a few pieces for a soundtrack, something that had often been requested by players. The result was 7 distinct pieces that play during competitive matches and one more ambient piece for the tutorial. Zero G Arena is not a very plot or setting focused game, so I wasn't sure what style to go with. This probably comes across in the drastic differences in style between some of the tracks. I did try to make sure that they all worked well against ZGA's action-packed gameplay though. Some players even reported that they appreciated the variety in the soundtrack.
  </p>
  <p>
  The full soundtrack is not currently available anywhere outside of the game itself (I'm still deciding what to do on this front), <a href=https://soundcloud.com/user-467390874/zero-g-arena-soundtrack-idea-demo-1 target="_blank">but here's an early demo for one of the pieces.</a>
