  <h3>Zero G Arena</h3>
  <p>Zero G Arena is a fully released PC game that I developed over the course of about three and a half years. It's an online multiplayer competetive shooter game with unique zero gravity mechanics.</p>

  <h4>Technology:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Unreal Engine 4</li>
    <li>C++</li>
    <li>Blueprint Visual Scripting</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Achievements:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Building an AI from scratch to accomodate ZGA's unique game mechanics. This involved creating custom navigation systems.</li>
    <li>Implementing networked gameplay.</li>
    <li>Finishing a fully-featured comercial game project. Happily, the game was well received by players with a review score of 90% at the time of writing (which peaked at 97% when the game had a more active playerbase).
    <li>Acting on player feedback to improve the game over the course of 2 years in Early Access.</li>
  </ul>

<h2> Projects with Cassette</h2>
<p> I worked on the following projects while contracting as an Unreal Developer for Cassette, a department within the marketing company TRO. They were all made with the Unreal Engine. I used a mixture of C++ and Blueprint Visual Scripting on these projects.</p>

<div class="project">
  <h3>BMW i-racing</h3>
  <p>This was a simple racing game for BMW which was featured at Formula E races.</p>
  <a href="https://www.wearecassette.com/projects/bmw-i-racing" target="_blank">More information about BMW i-racing on the Cassette website</a>
  <p>My responsibilities on this project included:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Implementing much of the UI logic.</li>
    <li>Implementing much of the game logic, including state flow and a simple AI.</li>
  </ul>

<h2> Personal Projects</h2>
<p>I have undertaken a large number of projects in my spare time, for practice and/or for fun. Some of these are on my Github: https://github.com/Jonwod. I will outline some of these that are the most complete or otherwise interesting in some way.</p>

<div class="project">
  <h3>Space Game</h3>
  <p>My first non-trivial programming project. It's a (pretty generic) 2d top down space shooter, not unlike the classic arcade game "Asteroids". This was only ever supposed to be a learning project, but it was extremely effective for learning C++ and game programming in general.</p>
  <p>The comparitively low-level nature of SFML (as compared to game engines like UE4) provided a great introduction to a lot of the more low-level problems in game development.</p>
  <a href=https://github.com/Jonwod/SpaceGame target="_blank">Here's the source code on Github</a>
  <h4>Technology</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>C++</li>
    <li>SFML</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="project">
  <h3>Simple Evolution Simulator</h3>
  <p>A fun little side project that I embarked upon for a brief break from Zero G Arena. I wanted to make a simulated environment with (imperfectly) self-replicating organisms. I did actually achieve this, although the result wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped. I would have liked to develop the project further (and I'm sure I'll do something like this again), but felt I needed to get back to Zero G Arena. </p>
